# Oracle of Suits
This is the Oracle of Suits project of the [Master Media Design](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/programs-research/master-arts-media-design), [HEAD – Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/head/), [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/accueil) in collaboration with the [Musée suisse du jeu](https://museedujeu.ch/).

## Goal
We are designing embodied, playful, and accessible interactive experiences that tell the stories behind playing card suits for a future exhibition at the [Swiss Museum of Games](https://museedujeu.ch/).

## Groupe "Builder"
Card Customizer is an interactive installation that lets visitors design their own playing cards by selecting parameters like shape, color, and symbols. Each choice generates a unique deck, turning the history of card design into a creative, hands-on experience. The installation bridges museum artifact and design tool, inviting users to explore centuries of visual evolution through play.
